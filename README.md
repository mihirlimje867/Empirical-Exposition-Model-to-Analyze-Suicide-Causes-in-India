# Empirical-Exposition-Model-to-Analyze-Suicide-Causes-in-India
Each suicide is a personal tragedy that prematurely takes the life of an individual and  has a continuing ripple effect, dramatically affecting the lives of families, friends and  communities. Every year, more than 1,00,000 people commit suicide in our country.There are 
various causes of suicides like professional/career problems, sense of isolation, abuse, violence, 
family problems, mental disorders, addiction to alcohol, financial loss, chronic pain etc. NCRB 
collects data on suicides from police recorded suicide cases. Most public attention in India has 
focused on suicide in farmers. The age- and sex-specific death totals, rates and risks and the 
mode of suicide in Indiaâ€™s markedly diverse socio-demographic populations are not well 
understood. The WHO states that about one-third of its Member States provide high-quality suicide 
data. It will be important to examine the accuracy and reliability of suicide data from India and China 
in particular since the results from these mega-nations will strongly affect conclusions about global 
suicide rates and factors that influence them
